<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Nuria GÃ³mez SÃ¡nchez del Valle ðŸ‘‹</h1>

Among all of my interests, I highlight data analysis and machine learning techniques.ðŸ’»

The repositories of my profile have been created as a result of work I had to do for university that I think turned out well and are interesting. I hope you find something useful in them, and feel free to collaborate if you see it necessary.ðŸŒ±
